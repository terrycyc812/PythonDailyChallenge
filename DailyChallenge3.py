# Create a function that calculates how many times an integer can be divided by another given integer. 
# If the answer of resulting divisions does not result in an integer, that division is not counted towards the number of times. 
# As an example:
# If n is 10 and divisor is 3, since in the first division 10/3 doesn't return an integer, 
# this division doesn't count towards the number of times and therefore its number of times should be 0.

def divisions(n, divisor):
    number_of_times = 0
    if n % divisor == 0:
        a = n
        while a % divisor == 0:
            a /= divisor
            number_of_times +=1
    return number_of_times

print(divisions(10, 3))
print(divisions(16, 2))
